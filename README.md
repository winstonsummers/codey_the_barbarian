### Codey the Barbarian

<em>A simple bot born in low valleys of the paciffic northwest, he conquers his foes with literary prowess!</em>

Codey is a python bot designed to emulate the writing of Robert E. Howard. The cool thing about how this, and similar, bots work is that you can change the style it writes in by changing the text you give it. I believe Conan was a good choice because there are seventeen open domain short stories that I could use.

This code is fairly simple and I have left in comments for the parts that aren't very human readable for clarity. Hopefully others can use this for thier education as I made it for mine.

Below I have my goals as I have reached them so far; aswell as my primary resources for understanding and starting. I highly recommend the Youtube video for a base model and that you build from there. The host of the video explains the concept at a high level so you can understand what is going on as you follow along and with a little more reading have a strong grasp of the concepts at hand.

Further more, I hope you enjoy Codey the Barbarian as much as I have!
